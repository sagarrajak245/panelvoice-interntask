## Introduction
My name is **Tushar Chaudhary**. You may or may not find me on LinkedIn, as I haven’t actively maintained my profile since my college days. I have been working in the same organization since my 3rd year of college, and I am not looking for a job change in the near future either, so I haven’t focused much on updating it.  

This is my **personal project**, which I’ve been working on for the past **6–7 months**. It is now close to completion, and I plan to launch it around **Diwali**. The project is centered around the **manga/novel/anime community**. I’ve already developed 4–5 AI-powered features of different kinds, and the core functionality is mostly complete.  

## What I’m Looking For
I’m looking for someone to collaborate with me on **supporting but critical components** of the project, such as:  
- **Authentication**: Secure login/signup and user management.  
- **Payment Integration**: Setting up reliable and user-friendly payment systems.  
- **Frontend Development**: Building and refining the UI to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.  

These tasks are vital to the overall success of the platform, even though the main AI functionalities are already completed.  

## Expectations
- **Commitment**: 6 hours per day, 5 days a week.  
- **Stipend**: Weekly stipend available to ensure transparency and trust.  
- **Documentation**: Offer letter and experience letter will be provided.  

## Benefits
- Work on a **real-world project** that is set to launch around **Diwali**.  
- Gain **hands-on experience** with authentication, payment systems, and frontend development.  
- By the end of the internship, the project will be live, giving you the opportunity to showcase your contribution in your **resume/portfolio**.
